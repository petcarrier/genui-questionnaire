I need some kind of website or app where people can see what plays are coming up, buy tickets, and maybe choose their seats? We do about 8 shows a year with 12-15 performances each. Our audience is mostly older folks (like 50+) but we want to attract younger people too. I have absolutely no idea how websites work or what's possible. My nephew mentioned something about 'WordPress' but I don't know if that's right for us. We're a non-profit with very little money to spend. Oh, and it would be amazing if our volunteer ushers could use something on their phones to scan tickets instead of checking paper lists. Is this even possible? Where do I even start with this whole digital thing?"
